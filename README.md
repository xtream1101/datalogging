#Datalogging

This project is to provide a central database to store datapoints from sensors and/or scripts.

There is a web interface that you can create api keys so you can add data to the sites database by going to a url with the correct arguments.

The data is not displayed anywhere on the site, but you can use another api key that is linked to a host for security to pull your sensor data from the database and display it anywhere you like.
